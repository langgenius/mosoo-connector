# Agent Manifest Workflow

Prefer the product workflow commands for editable Agent manifest YAML:

```sh
mosoo agent manifest probe --app-id <app-id> --agent-id <agent-id> --out agent.yaml
mosoo agent manifest diff --app-id <app-id> --agent-id <agent-id> --file agent.yaml
mosoo agent manifest apply --app-id <app-id> --agent-id <agent-id> --file agent.yaml --dry-run
mosoo agent manifest apply --app-id <app-id> --agent-id <agent-id> --file agent.yaml
```

`probe` reads the current remote manifest and writes YAML for editing or version
control. It also has a `pull` alias. `diff` performs a local field-level diff
between the local YAML target state and the current remote state.

`apply` always fetches the current remote manifest before writing, treats the
local YAML as the intended patch, preserves remote fields omitted from the YAML,
and then calls the Agent config update operation. Use `--dry-run` first to show
the field-level changes without writing.

When changing prompts, models, providers, tools, runtime, or environment
settings, do not reconstruct an update payload from memory or guessed defaults.
Round-trip the current manifest, edit only the requested fields, and preserve
unchanged values such as `environmentId`, runtime, provider, model, skill IDs,
MCP server IDs, and `providerOptions`.

The `console agents manifest` and `console agents update-config` commands are
specialized inspection commands. Prefer the manifest workflow commands for
normal configuration changes.
