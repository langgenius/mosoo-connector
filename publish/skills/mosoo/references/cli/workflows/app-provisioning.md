# Agent App Provisioning Workflow

Use this workflow when a task starts from App and Agent setup instead of an
already published Agent.

First select the App boundary. For a new application, create a new App. Reuse
an existing App only when the user explicitly supplied its `appId`, or when its
name and purpose exactly match the current application after live verification.
Existing credentials or a working model are not sufficient reasons to reuse an
App.

After the App boundary is selected, create the Agent and publish it. Run the CLI
commands in order and save each returned `appId` and `agentId` before moving to
the next step:

```sh
mosoo console apps app-list --organization-id <organization-id> -o json
mosoo console apps create-app --input-organization-id <organization-id> --input-name <app-name> -o json
mosoo console agents create-agent --file create-agent.json -o json
mosoo console agents publish-agent --input-app-id <app-id> --input-agent-id <agent-id> -o json
```

After publish, continue through the related workflow files instead of
duplicating their commands here:

1. Write backend or Worker env values with `public-api-tokens.md`.
2. Upload attachments only when the first thread requires files; use
   `thread-files.md`.
3. Run a smoke test by creating a Public Thread and waiting for final output
   with `thread-run.md`.
4. If Agent configuration needs a follow-up change, round-trip it through
   `agent-manifest.md`.

Use `mosoo commands show <path...> --json` before each command to confirm body
shape and required flags. Prefer `--file` for large Agent create bodies. If a
step fails or times out, inspect state with `console apps app-list`, `console
agents accessible-agent-list`, or `console agents agent` before retrying; do
not recreate resources until the current remote state is known.
