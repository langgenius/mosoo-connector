# CLI Reference

Generated from Lathe's mosoo CLI Skill output during `make build`.

## Runtime State

Run:

```sh
mosoo doctor --json
```

Use the result to decide whether the current task targets local Mosoo runtime or
Mosoo cloud runtime before running API commands.

## Command Selection

Use generated CLI commands for Mosoo resource operations, and use
`references/api.md` for application code that calls an already published Agent.
Do not invent a wrapper command when the generated catalog already exposes the
operation.

For a new App, Agent creation, publishing, credential setup, or Console/API
inspection, search the generated catalog first. For app environment files only,
derive `MOSOO_API_BASE`, `MOSOO_AGENT_ID`, and `MOSOO_API_TOKEN` from the
published Agent/API contract instead of creating new resources.

Use this reference when a user asks you to operate `mosoo`, inspect its API commands, or find the right generated command for an API task.

## Public API Tokens

`MOSOO_API_TOKEN` is a server-side credential for application backends or
Workers that call a published Agent through the Public API. Do not expose it in
browser or frontend code.

Users can create multiple Mosoo API tokens and assign each token an
application-level purpose or logical scope in their own app backend. For
example, an app can keep one token for a production Agent integration, another
token for smoke tests, and its own metadata that decides which app users or
workflows may use each token.

Mosoo validates the token. The calling app is responsible for selecting the
right token, storing any app-level scope metadata, and enforcing business rules
before calling Mosoo. For multi-user apps, keep tenant and user mapping in the
app backend; a single token does not switch Mosoo identity based on request
payload fields.

When writing app env files, store token values only in backend or Worker
environment files and redact token values in logs, examples, and command
output.

## Workflow

1. Search for candidates with `mosoo search "<intent>" --json`; use `--limit` when needed. Search is only candidate discovery.
2. Inspect the exact command with `mosoo commands show <path...> --json` before executing an unfamiliar command.
3. If the command detail has `auth.required=true`, run `mosoo auth status --hostname <host>` before execution. Use `http.default_hostname` when present unless the user provides `--hostname` or `$MOSOO_HOST`.
4. Execute only after flags, body, auth, HTTP path, and output hints are clear from `commands show`.

## General Commands

- `mosoo commands --json`: full generated command catalog.
- `mosoo commands --include-hidden --json`: include hidden generated commands.
- `mosoo commands show <path...> --json`: source of truth for one command.
- `mosoo commands schema --json`: catalog schema version for parser compatibility.
- `mosoo search "<intent>" --json`: ranked candidate commands.

## References

- Read `references/cli/catalog.md` for the command discovery protocol and catalog field meanings.
- Read `references/cli/modules/console.md` for the `console` module command index.
- Read `references/cli/modules/console-rest.md` for the `console-rest` module command index.
- Read `references/cli/modules/public-thread-api.md` for the `public-thread-api` module command index.

## Rules

- Do not guess flags or request body shape from command names.
- Do not execute directly from search results; confirm with `commands show` first.
- Prefer `-o json` for machine-readable command output unless the user asks for human-readable output.
- Use `--file`, `--set`, or `--set-str` for JSON request bodies according to `commands show` body requirements.
